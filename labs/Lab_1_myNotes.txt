    -- Cell Operations can be performed using options in main toolbar such as "Edit", "Insert","Cell".
    
    -- Please have a look into the Kernel, this would be useful while running the codes.
    -- Help provides a large relief 
    
    
    1A. Finding the version of python currently running in system
    import sys
    sys.version 
    # Provides a description of the python system version, as of today the version is 2.7.5, last installed is also shown

    sys.version_info 
    # Suffixing the _info would provide details of version in parts.
