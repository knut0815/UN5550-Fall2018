Additionally, figure 8.10 shows that rendition when page rank is used to determine the size of the node.  As mentioned earlier, the page rank algorithm is a variant of the eigenvector centrality measure.  The difference, is they generate a Markov transition matrix, $M$, to mimic a random walk through the network.  Applying this transition matrix iteratively results in a page rank vector, whose $i$-th entry corresponds to a web surfer visiting page $i$.  There is a built-in networkX command to compute the pagerank vector."
